# HikariCP Timeout Demo

A demonstration project showing how connection timeouts work in HikariCP with Scala.


## Overview
This project demonstrates various scenarios with HikariCP connection pooling:
- Connection timeout when non-DB work blocks a connection
- Connection timeout when a long-running query blocks other queries

## Requirements
PostgreSQL database running on localhost:5432
```
docker compose up -d
```
